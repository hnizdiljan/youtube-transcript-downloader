## Introduction

YouTube Transcript Downloader is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices regarding any information that might be collected or processed while using our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

We want to assure our users that our extension:

- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not store any user data
- Does not transmit any information to external servers

The YouTube Transcript Downloader extension only accesses publicly available transcript information from YouTube videos when explicitly requested by the user. All processing is done locally on the user's device.

## Information Access and Processing

Our extension only accesses the following:

1. The URL of the current YouTube video page (to verify if a transcript is available)
2. The publicly available transcript data of the YouTube video (when requested by the user)

This information is used solely for the purpose of downloading and displaying the video transcript to the user. It is not stored, collected, or transmitted elsewhere.

## Data Storage

As our extension does not collect or store any user data, there are no data storage practices to disclose.

## Third-party Access

We do not share any data with third parties, as we do not collect any data in the first place.

## User Rights

As we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no personal information for users to access, modify, or delete.

## Security

While our extension does not handle personal data, we are committed to ensuring its secure operation. The extension is regularly updated to comply with the latest security standards set by Google for Chrome extensions.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time, particularly if future versions of the extension introduce new features. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Children's Privacy
